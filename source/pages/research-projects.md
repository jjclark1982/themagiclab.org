      <b>Robust Intelligence: Rational Decision-Making under Risk and
      Uncertainty</b>
    summary: >
      Intelligent agents exercise profound and growing impact in business and
      society. However, significant problems

      arise in intelligent agent deployment as their theoretical underpinnings
      do not ensure rational decision making in

      complex real-world settings. This project will bridge the gap between
      theory and practice with an innovative

      framework for rational decision making under risk and uncertainty. It will
      open the door to previously unimaginable

      transformational technologies that will drive new entrepreneurial
      opportunities in agent-based global services.

    summary: >-
      The VOICE Project involves eight University Partners. It aims to help
      bridge the gap in the broader entrepreneurial development ecosystem by
      providing an international, virtual innovation and entrepreneurship
      ecosystem based on open innovation, crowdsourcing and co-creation
      principles; where individual users and start-ups will meet, find
      collaborators and partners, co-create ideas and prototypes, utilise the
      wisdom of the crowd to assess the value of the project idea and/or
      prototype, share and find connections/partners, business and technical
      information, knowledge on start-up related topics, online tools, online
      content and open educational material as well as access to capital and
      crowd-funding.

    summary: >-
      This project led by Professor Mary-Anne Williams is designed to develop a
      data analytics mindset in the bank and enhance CBA's predictive analytics
      capabiliites providing  extraordinary opportunities for UTS staff and
      students. The project engaged Data Analytics Leaders at CBA, key Magic Lab
      researchers (Dr Benjamin Johnston and Dr Xun Wang), Magic Lab PhD Students
      (Mayha, Pramod, Ali, Nima), the UTS Business School, and Ernst and Young.
      CBA have hired several UTS students involved in the project as data
      scientists and invited UTS students to engage with them in the CBA
      Innovation Lab.

    projecttitle: <b>Building a Social Robotics Ecosystem</b>
    summary: >-
      This AJF project will develop new Australia-Japan relationships through
      knowledge sharing in social robotics. Social robots are expected to have a
      significant impact on national technological capabilities. Social robots
      are a disruptive technology and therefore of significant importance to the
      future of Australia and Japan. A disruptive technology is an innovation
      that eventually goes on to displace an earlier technology often creating a
      new market or industry in the process.
