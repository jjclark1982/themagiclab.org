The Innovation and Enterprise Research Laboratory is an exciting research space at the University of Technology Sydney. The lab is home to creative people who enjoy sharing knowledge, know-how and insights as we work with unique high-tech and robot resources.

Our primary objective is to design and make disruptive technologies that can take decisions, learn, and adapt to change as they delight and collaborate with people.

We can work with you on strategic innovation, entrepreneurship, data analytics, design thinking, artificial intelligence, social robotics, and the Internet of All Things.

If you would like to work with us on a collaborative project; to discover how you can make a diiference or take your careeer to the next level with a higher degree, please contact us.

We are particularly keen to hear from those wanting to make the world work better with decision making technologies that can take action based on the data and evidence they gather.
