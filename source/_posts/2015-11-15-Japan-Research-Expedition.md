Five researchers from the Magic Lab undertake a two-week Research Expedition to Japan to develop new collaborative projects with the University of Tokyo, Osaka University and SONY. Going to Japan to see Robots is like time-travel into the Future. This expedition has been two years in the making and funded by the Australia-Japan Foundation.
