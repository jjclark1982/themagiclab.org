            <div class="data-field data-field-text"><p>Our laboratory is an exciting place for you to learn about how technology can be used to drive transformation and to develop your capabilities for innovation. Our lab has state-of-the-art technologies and know-how, advanced robots and we strive for innovative high-impact outcomes. By doing a PhD in the lab, you will have access to our global research network while working with enthusiastic and friendly researchers who will help you to become a world-leader in technology-led innovaitont. Our past students have started their own business, led innovation at places like Google, Telstra, IBM, Atlassian, Macquarie Bank, Amazon, CBA, Animal Logic, CSIRO, Visual Risk, ASX, Cochlear. They have also remained close friends and ongoing collaborators. You can find some fo them on our People page.</p>
<p>Our former students have founded new businesses and secured exciting jobs as creative researchers in university and industry, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and making a difference to society. We hope to help you reach your goals too.</p>
<p>We are looking for motivated and innovative students who will contribute to the life and scholarship of The Magic Lab. The ideal student simply has a creative and curious mind with analytical reasoning skills and an ability to adapt and  learn independently. You do not need to be a programmer, computer scientist, engineer, roboticist, lawyer or mathematician. However, talent in one (or more) of these areas will provide a great foundation from which to launch your next life adventure!</p>
