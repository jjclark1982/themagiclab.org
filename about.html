<p>The Innovation and Enterprise Research Laboratory (“The Magic Lab”) conducts transdisciplinary research into disruptive technologies that will change society in the coming decade. We are currently creating socially-aware robots, analytics-enabled organisations and smart software for the internet of things.</p>
<p>Our core expertise is in the automation of effective decision making and in the sophisticated management of knowledge. We can help you by applying this expertise in many areas. Some of our interests in technology and methods are listed in the table below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>Socially-aware robots</li>
<li>Data Analytics</li>
<li>Decision Making under Risk and Uncertainty</li>
<li>Human-Robot Interaction</li>
<li>Social and group behavior</li>
<li>Law, privacy and intellectual property</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship and New Ventures</li>
<li>Design Thinking</li>
<li>Business Strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>We are enthusiastic about applying our research to real problems. If your organisation would benefit from new thinking about technology, please get in touch with the lab director.</p>
<p>We are passionate about developing the next generation of leaders. We are looking for brilliant and creative students. If you think this might be you, please apply.</p>

</span><span class="data-field data-field-text"><p>Our laboratory is an exciting place for you to learn about technology and to develop your capabilities for innovation. Our lab has state-of-the-art technologies, advanced robots and strives for innovative high-impact outcomes. By doing a PhD in the lab, you will have access to our global research network and work with enthusiastic and friendly researchers who will help you to become a world-leader in an area of interest. Our past students have graduated with a highly regarded degree and have remained close friends and ongoing collaborators.</p>
<p>Our former students have founded new businesses and secured exciting jobs as creative researchers in university and industry, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and making a difference to society. We hope to help you reach your goals too.</p>
<p>Magic Lab alumni can be found at Google, Telstra, IBM, Atlassian, Macquarie Bank, Amazon, CBA, Animal Logic, CSIRO, Visual Risk, ASX, Cochlear.</p>
<p>We are looking for motivated and innovative students who will contribute to the life and scholarship of the laboratory. The ideal student simply has a creative and curious mind with analytical reasoning skills and an ability to adapt and  learn independently. You do not need to be a programmer, computer scientist, engineer, roboticist, lawyer or mathematician. However, talent in one (or more) of these areas will provide a great foundation from which to launch your next life adventure!</p>
